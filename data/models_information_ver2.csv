884155819,OCR-Donut-CORD,,5,80,"The OCR-Donut-CORD model is a deep learning model designed to perform document parsing without the need for traditional OCR (Optical Character Recognition) preprocessing. It directly interprets visual content from document images and extracts meaningful information in the form of structured data, such as JSON format. Based on the Donut architecture, this model integrates a vision encoder (Swin Transformer) with a text decoder (BART) to convert images of receipts into structured text outputs and handle various tasks like document classification, information extraction, and visual question answering. It has been fine-tuned on the CORD dataset, which is specifically aimed at post-OCR receipt parsing. ","20,25,16,2","{""model"":""OCR_DONUT_CORD"",""inputText"":""image""}","{""data"":""text""}","- No OCR preprocessing required: Unlike traditional OCR models that first extract text and then process it, this model directly processes images into structured information, improving efficiency.
- High accuracy: This model achieves good performance in parsing receipts and documents, leveraging the power of transformers like Swin for image encoding and BART for text decoding.
- Versatile: This model can be fine-tuned for a variety of downstream document tasks, making it adaptable across different document parsing tasks beyond receipts.","- Model complexity: the OCR-Donut-CORD model requires a significant amount of pre-processing and fine-tuning, making it computationally expensive and slow for large-scale processing.
